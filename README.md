# Software configuration management, Introduction to project management and version control

### Using a version control system and why it matters.

**Wikipedia** : "Version control is a component of software configuration management. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed."

#### Project

Example details are grouped into subject related points and showcase investigation result on the subject of libraries. Further details will be provided on more advance features that are covered in the making of our examples.

#### What this README.md is not

Be aware that some of the tooling used in the making of this `Demo` project won't be covered here. External documentations will be provided for your own benefit, which in most case, are also where most of the information mentioned here will be coming from.

## What's Software configuration management

**Wikipedia** : "Software configuration management is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management. "

#### Version control (or Revision control)

**Wikipedia** : "In computer software engineering, revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code."

# How does it works?

**Wikipedia** : "When data that is under revision control is modified, after being retrieved by checking out, this is not in general immediately reflected in the revision control system (in the repository), but must instead be checked in or committed. "

# Types of version control systems

### Distributed

Distributed version control (also known as distributed revision control) is a form of version control in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer's computer. This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up most operations, improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.

### Centralized
