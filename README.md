# Software configuration management, Introduction to project management and version control

### Using a version control system and why it matters.

**Microsoft** : "Version control synchronizes versions and makes sure that changes don't conflict with changes from others. The team relies on version control to help resolve and prevent conflicts, even when people make changes at the same time."

#### Project

Example details are grouped into subject related points and showcase investigation result on the subject of libraries. Further details will be provided on more advance features that are covered in the making of our examples.

#### What this README.md is not

Be aware that some of the tooling used in the making of this `Demo` project won't be covered here. External documentations will be provided for your own benefit, which in most case, are also where most of the information mentioned here will be coming from.

## What's Software configuration management

**Wikipedia** : "Software configuration management is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management. "

#### Version control (or Revision control)

**Wikipedia** : "Version control is a component of software configuration management. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed."

# How does it works?

**Wikipedia** : "When data that is under revision control is modified, after being retrieved by checking out, this is not in general immediately reflected in the revision control system (in the repository), but must instead be checked in or committed. For source code control, the working copy (copy outside revision control) is a copy of all files in a particular revision, generally stored locally on the developer's computer. In this case saving the file only changes the working copy, and checking into the repository is a separate step."
